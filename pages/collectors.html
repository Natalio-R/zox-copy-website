            ZOX was created by my two brothers and I at the end of 2010 with
            four pillars in mind:
          </p>
          <p><strong>Collectibility</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

          <h2>Serial numbers & stitching</h2>
          <p>
            Each Strap is hand stitched together with a tag that has a laser cut
            serial number on the inside. The outside of this tag contains our
            trademark ZOX logo in metallic thread. If serial number of the Strap
            is No. 0001 - 0100, the stitching will be in gold. If it's No. 0101
            and above, it'll be in silver. First generation ZOX use white thread
            for No. 0101+, as well as have the word STRAPS under the logo on the
            outside. On the secondary market, Gold stitched Straps (referred to
            simply as 'Golds') tend to command a premium as they're the rarest
            of any design.

          <h2>Rarity</h2>
          <p>
            In 2018, we introduced a rarity scale to help make collecting even
            easier. The following terms are used to indicate the worldwide
            release quantities of each design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p><strong>Grails:</strong> 100 or less</p>
          <p><strong>Legends:</strong> 1,000 or less</p>
          <p><strong>Exclusives:</strong> 3,000 or less</p>
          <p><strong>Necessities:</strong> 5,000 or less</p>
          <p><strong>Essentials:</strong> 10,000+</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            *Anomalies are designs that have a variation in color or pattern
            that makes it so ZOX is a little bit different.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It's important to note that each design is only made once and never
            reproduced. If you're looking for a sold out Strap, your best option
            is visit <a href="#">ZOXLIST</a>, a group we moderate to help people
            buy, sell and trade.

          <h2>Collector card & packaging</h2>
          <p>
            Collector cards come packed with each Strap (in a resealable package
            made from 100% post-consumer plastic) as a way to verify it's
            authenticity. On the front of each card is the name of the Strap,
            along with a laser engraved number that matches the tag. On the back
            of the cards are more details about the Strap, along with a gold
            foiled ZOX logo.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            First generation ZOX have paper cards without engraved serial
            numbers or gold foil logos. You'll also notice that there are a few
            variations of resealable packages that these Straps came in.

          <h2>General Releases</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>COLLECTION </strong> Straps are the original Straps created
            in-house by my brothers and I. Each one includes a Collection No.
            designation on the inside to indicate how new the addition is to the
            series. Collection Straps recently had an increase in 2017 to 2,000
            pieces made. Before that they were limited to just 1,000.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>COLLAB </strong>
            Straps are made with established artists as a showcase of their
            work. Similar to a limited run of prints, each Collab Strap is
            individually numbered by design. Collabs vary in quantity but are
            still made in one-time runs, typically consisting of 5,000 pieces or
            less.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>CREATE </strong>Straps are made by artist submission and
            voting within the ZOX Community. If Create designs reach at least
            250 pre-orders within their two week debut, they are fully funded
            and 5,000 pieces are made. If they don't reach the 250 threshold
            they become White Stars.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>IMPACT </strong>Straps are only made for causes we're trying
            to help raise money and awareness for. Their quantities will vary by
            need.

          <h2>Gifts we give</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>F&F </strong>
            (Friends and Family) Straps are known for their trademark XO pattern
            on the outside with a picture of Kirby on the inside. These Straps
            are never sold, we only give them away as gifts to members of the
            VIP community. Typically there's one colorway of an F&F released a
            year before it's retired forever, like all our other Straps.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>CAKE </strong>Straps are sent out to VIP members who are on
            our birthday list as a free gift. To ensure you get emailed a code
            to get this gift you'll need to make sure you sign up for the VIP

            <strong>PURPLES </strong>
            are uber-rare purple stitched Straps that can only be earned.
            Currently there are two Purples in circulation - Friends with
            Benefits and Dark Horse. The latter is a throwback to the first ZOX
            that was handpainted in 2010.

          <h2>Rare Straps</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>MASHUPS </strong>
            are unique combinations of two existing Straps we believe work
            really well together. They include a special designation on the
            inside and are typically limited to just 1,000 pieces total.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>PEARLS</strong>are monthly limited edition Straps that come
            packed along side a matching enamel pin in a special magnetic
            collectors box. They are only available via membership which is
            limited to just 1,000 people. Pearls are the only Straps with logos
            stitched in metallic pearl white.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>WHITE STARS</strong>
            are created just for Mystery Packs and are never available for sale
            on our site. They're either made in house by my brothers and I or
            from Create submissions that don't meet the 250 pre-order threshold.
            In the latter scenario, all pre-orders of the Create Strap are
            fulfilled and the rest are put in Mystery Packs. White Stars are
            only made with 1,000 pieces per design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>BLACK STARS</strong> are some of the rarest Straps ever
            made. They are limited to just 100 pieces total and are only found
            in Mystery Packs.

          <h2>ZOXBOXES</h2>
          <p>
            ZOXBOXES are very rare sets of eight number-matching Straps we
            package together in a commemorative box. During the first 100
            Collection Straps, we released one for every 10th Collection design.
            Now, as we're going from Collection No. 101 - 200 we're releasing
            them every 20th Collection design. This trend will continue from 201
            - 300 with every 30th Collection design, 301 - 400 getting one every
            40th Collection and so on til they're only released on every 100th
            Collection design.

          <h2>Mystery Packs</h2>
          <p>
            Created as a fun, exciting way to experience ZOX, Mystery Packs are
            one of the most popular items on our entire site. It's not hard to
            see why either - Mystery Packs are the only way to find ultra-rare
            Black Stars, White Stars and even sold out/ unreleased Straps
            without buying at a significant markup on the secondary market. Each
            Pack contains 3 sealed foil packages with no clue of what Straps are
            inside. A subscription to Mystery Packs (The Mystery Club) get's you
            a new pack every month, as well as access into The Secret Stash.

          <h2>Secret Stash</h2>
          <p>
            This is a portion of the site only accessible to those with
            memberships to the monthly Mystery, String, Imperial or Pearl Club.
            Originally created as a thank you for monthly Club members, the
            Secret Stash now has exclusive releases of it's own. Some are early
            releases before pieces hit the main site, others are exclusive to
            the Stash and will never be released elsewhere. Average rarity of
            Stash exclusives is 1,000 pieces per design.
