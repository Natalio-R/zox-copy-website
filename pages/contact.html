          <div class="answer">
            Unfortunately during this time, the average processing time and
            shipping time have both gone up. We are doing our very best to be
            able to efficiently ship out all orders however, the delivery of the
            actual order may be delayed at this time due to local restrictions
            based on your shipping address.<br />
            <br />
            We are currently unable to ship to all countries as many countries
            have closed down their borders to receiving packages from us. As
            soon as we are able to, we will make shipping there an option on our
            site again.<br />
            <br />
            Thank you for your understanding, stay safe.

            Medical Worker Discounts COVID-19
            <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            We're all going through a lot right now, but I wanted to take a
            moment and remind you of the people who need our support now more
            than ever before: Our medical workers. The doctors, nurses,
            caregivers and essential staff who are working around the clock,
            putting themselves in dangerous conditions to save the lives of
            complete strangers. To me, their selfless acts are a true reflection
            of what we, as a human race, need more of right now: Compassion.
            They are the true heroes of today and we wanted to help all of you
            show your appreciation of their service.<br />
            <br />
            To help celebrate medical workers around the world, we've made our
            Give Life ZOX 50% off when you have anything else in your cart along
            with it. This discount is automatically applied for you at checkout
            (with no maximum amount) , so you can get as many as you'd
            like(while supplies last) without even needing to add a discount
            code.<br />
            <br />
            Our hope is that you'll use these as gifts for people risking their
            lives to save ours. They're a perfect way of acknowledging and
            showing appreciation for their sacrifices as a small gift they'll be
            able to wear for years to come.<br />
            <br />
            Thanks for supporting these heroes, hope you are all staying safe. Ô∏è

          <div class="answer">
            We have recently introduced a kids size option to a few of our

            How do I redeem a Moonstone?
            <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            Congratulations on collecting an entire Mystery Pack
            mini-collection! To redeem your Moonstone you'll need to send the
            collector cards to us.<br />
            <br />
            Please make sure to fill out this form before sending them in:
            <a href="https://zox.la/pages/moonstone"
              >https://zox.la/pages/moonstone</a
            ><br />
            <br />
            There are only 200 of each Moonstone, if the one you're trying to
            redeem is out of stock, we're sorry but that means you will be
            unable to receive it. <br />
            <br />
            Please give us a few business days after receiving your collector
            cards to have your Moonstone sent out. It takes quite a bit of time
            to prep everything and have an order sent out.

            How long does it take to ship?
            <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            We do everything we can to get orders shipped out as soon as they
            come in, which is usually 2-3 business days but may take 4-6 if we
            have a large influx of orders.<br />
            <br />
            To keep our Straps affordable we ship all US orders of $35 or more
            absolutely free via DHL eCommerce. This means orders being shipped
            within the United States are typically delivered within 3-4 days but
            have been known to take up to 10 days on very rare occasions.<br />
            <br />
            Business days are considered Monday through Friday.

            Sometimes issues arise and we're so very sorry about that. If you
            placed an order and you're missing some of the contents or you
            received a different product then what you ordered, contact us using
            the form below. For us to be able to help as efficiently as
            possible, please send us details such as an order number, a photo of
            what you received, and information on what you are missing/what you
            received instead of something you ordered.

          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            As weird as it sounds, most of the time when we get this question
            it's usually because someone in your house took it and forgot to
            tell you, that, or it may be with your neighbors. That being said,
            we'd recommend checking with them first.<br />
            <br />
            If this happens to you and it's not with your neighbors or anyone
            with access to your mail, please contact your local post office.
            They have GPS tracking for exactly where the package was scanned as
            delivered, so it will make it much easier to track down.<br />
            <br />
            Please keep in mind that once we pass a package on to USPS, we no
            longer have any control over what happens to it, so for all delivery
            issues, you'll need to contact your local post office to get more
            info before we'll be able to do anything to help.

          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            This all depends on how busy we are. We prioritize emails from
            customers with questions that aren't answered in the FAQ, so if you
            haven't received a response, hopefully you'll be able to find an
            answer somewhere here.<br />
            <br />
            Also, it's important to keep in mind that our system is set to show
            oldest tickets first. If you email in while waiting to follow up,
            your ticket will be marked as brand new and won't show as close to
            the top as it would have.<br />
            <br />
            We respond to emails Monday-Friday, so if you email in on Friday
            night, the soonest you'll receive a response is Monday, but it
            typically takes 4-6 business days for us to respond to everyone
            depending on our workload, but we're working hard to expand our team
            to cut response time down.

          <div class="answer">
            That‚Äôs not good! Our releases are all sent out through email, so
            it‚Äôs important to get that sorted out. Typically, we‚Äôve found that
            this issue is caused by emails going to your spam folder. If that‚Äôs
            not the case, your email may have bounced from your email provider.
            This usually happens when your inbox is full, your email provider
            was down, or the message was too large for your inbox. Before
            reaching out, please check to make sure messages are not in your
            spam and that you have sufficient space in your inbox for our
            messages. If you still don‚Äôt receive emails, feel free to reach out
            and we‚Äôll see what we can do to help.

          <div class="answer">
            If you have lost or forgotten your password, don't worry, it's very
            easy to fix. All you will need to do is go here and click the
            'Forgot Password' link. That should bring you to a page to enter
            your email and then we will shoot you over a message to set up a new
            password to log in.<br />
            <br />
            If you have tried the above step and had an error saying you do not
            have an account. That would mean that you did not create an account
            prior to ordering or after you ordered. That is very easy to fix as
            well, to create an account with any previous order history you will
            need to click
            <a href="https://zox.la/pages/moonstone">here</a><br />
            <br />
            Make certain you use the same email address that you initially used
            for your order and it should sync correctly for you and have your
            points automatically added in.

            moment and remind you of the people who need our support now more
            than ever before: Our medical workers. The doctors, nurses,
            caregivers and essential staff who are working around the clock,
            putting themselves in dangerous conditions to save the lives of
            complete strangers. To me, their selfless acts are a true reflection
            of what we, as a human race, need more of right now: Compassion.
            They are the true heroes of today and we wanted to help all of you
            show your appreciation of their service.<br />
            <br />
            To help celebrate medical workers around the world, we've made our
            Give Life ZOX 50% off when you have anything else in your cart along
            with it. This discount is automatically applied for you at checkout
            (with no maximum amount) , so you can get as many as you'd
            like(while supplies last) without even needing to add a discount
            code.<br />
            <br />
            Our hope is that you'll use these as gifts for people risking their
            lives to save ours. They're a perfect way of acknowledging and
            showing appreciation for their sacrifices as a small gift they'll be
            able to wear for years to come.<br />
            <br />
            Thanks for supporting these heroes, hope you are all staying safe. Ô∏è

            We have recently introduced a kids size option to a few of our
            newest items. The kids sizes are the same ratio as our normal ZOX
            just shrunk down slighty. The sizing on them is 20mm wide by 145mm
            in length.

            Congratulations on collecting an entire Mystery Pack
            mini-collection! To redeem your Moonstone you'll need to send the
            collector cards to us.<br />
            <br />
            Please make sure to fill out this form before sending them in:
            <a href="moonstone.html">https://zox.la/pages/moonstone</a><br />
            <br />
            There are only 200 of each Moonstone, if the one you're trying to
            redeem is out of stock, we're sorry but that means you will be
            unable to receive it. <br />
            <br />
            Please give us a few business days after receiving your collector
            cards to have your Moonstone sent out. It takes quite a bit of time
            to prep everything and have an order sent out.

          <div class="answer">
            We do everything we can to get orders shipped out as soon as they
            come in, which is usually 2-3 business days but may take 4-6 if we
            have a large influx of orders.<br />
            <br />
            To keep our Straps affordable we ship all US orders of $35 or more
            absolutely free via DHL eCommerce. This means orders being shipped
            within the United States are typically delivered within 3-4 days but
            have been known to take up to 10 days on very rare occasions.<br />
            <br />
            Business days are considered Monday through Friday.

            Sometimes issues arise and we're so very sorry about that. If you
            placed an order and you're missing some of the contents or you
            received a different product then what you ordered, contact us using
            the form below. For us to be able to help as efficiently as
            possible, please send us details such as an order number, a photo of

            received instead of something you ordered.

            As weird as it sounds, most of the time when we get this question
            it's usually because someone in your house took it and forgot to
