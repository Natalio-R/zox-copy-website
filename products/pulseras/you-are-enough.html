                you could see what I see” is what my mom would say to me as I
                cried over how worthless I felt. Growing up is hard, especially
                in those awkward middle school years. I remember how insecure I
                felt about the acne on my face, the hair on my arms, and my
                curly hair. Trying to find your own place in the world, while
                doing it with self-confidence, is not an easy task. I would
                spend so much time letting my exterior determine my worth and
                value. As I got older and made it through high school and
                college, I was able to gain more confidence in who I was. I
                started to feel that I had a lot to offer to this world. Even
                though there still are plenty of times that I doubt my worth,
                whether that's when I compare myself to others, or maybe a
                relationship doesn't work out, I always have to remember that I
                am still enough. On the day you were born you were enough, today
                you are enough and you will continue to be enough for the rest
                of your days. No mirror, no person, no relationship, or any
                other circumstance gets to determine that. If you could only see
                all the wonderful things others see in you, there would be no
                doubt that you are so much more than enough.

                ZOX are made from a super soft polyester elastic. Care for your
                ZOX is super simple.
                <br /><br />
                &nbsp; 1. Toss it in the wash on cold. ZOX Collectors like to
                put them in pockets or washer bags for extra safety. <br />
                &nbsp; 2. Set it out to air dry. <br />
                &nbsp; 3. Enjoy!
                <br />
                <br />
                There's no set recommendation as to how often you should wash
                your ZOX. Just keep in mind that ZOX are made with fabric and is
                like any other piece of fabric clothing. The more you wear it
                and the "harder" you wear it, the faster it will wear out. Some
                customers are still wearing their daily after 2-3 years with
                proper care.

                we're certain you'll love your ZOX. Here's what you need to
                know: <br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;<b>·</b> If you're let down by your first ZOX, it's free.
                All you have to do is pass it on to a friend for a full refund
                on up to 3 ZOX in your first order. <br />
                &nbsp;<b>·</b> If you don't like the fit, we'll let you buy
                another ZOX for half price. <br />
                &nbsp;<b>·</b> If you order ZOX and can't wear it because of an
                allergy, we'll give you a full refund so you can pass it on to a
                friend.
                <br />
                <br />
                Please just make sure you check our size guide tab below to
                ensure you size yourself properly. Checking our size guide and
                ordering approriately is the safest way to ensure you love the

                Keep in mind if you take us up on our Happiness Guarantee and
                pass your ZOX onto a friend, you won't be able to buy from the
                product type again in the future. That's what allows us to do
                this without being taken advantage of.

                ZOXLOX - The Best Keychains

                Our ZOXLOX Keychain converters are inspired by ingenuity from
                Zoxers in our own community. In our VIP group, members started
                posting pictures of clamps that turned their ZOX into keychains.
                Unfortunately, the clamps were 1-time use and would ruin their
                ZOX. So, we stepped in to create something amazing.
                <br />
                <br />
                ZOXLOX are easy to use converters that will turn your ZOX
                Singles or Straps into the best keychains in the world. All you
                do is remove the screw, insert your ZOX wristband, and push the
                screw back in so the wristband is looped over it. Then, screw it
                back into place and just like that, your ZOX wristband is now a
                ZOX Keychain. And the best thing about it? You can easily swap
                your ZOX wristbands in and out to change your keychain any time
                you feel like it.
